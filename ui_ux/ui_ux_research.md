# UI/UX Research: Interfaces for NC Machine Operations

This document compiles a survey of user interfaces, dashboards, and interaction patterns relevant to a system that analyzes high‑frequency data from **Numerical Control (NC) machines** and transforms it into actionable insights. The research focuses on visual and interactive solutions that help operators and engineers understand **machine operation**, **energy usage**, **timing per program**, and **alerts**, with examples from different sources. The purpose of this research is also to give to the frontend developers some ideas and insights on how the team can approach the design of the UI/UX.

**The structure follows the project’s needs and proposes concrete UI components for each one, with references and example visuals.**

---

## 1) Identification of operation periods
- **Goal:** Clearly show periods of **RUN / IDLE / DOWN** and transitions over time.
- **RUN** → the machine is actively working (executing a program, cutting, milling, etc.).
- **IDLE** → the machine is powered on but not performing productive work (waiting, setup, no command).
- **DOWN** → the machine is stopped due to an error, maintenance, or shutdown

**UI patterns & components**
- **State timeline / band chart** (stacked color bands per machine state).
- **Utilization trend + thresholds** (sparklines, line charts with shift markers).
- **Gantt‑like run timeline per machine** (one row per machine; zoom & pan).
- **Shift overlays** (background shading for shifts/breaks).
- **Downtime reason overlay** (tooltips with coded reasons).

**Why this pattern works**
- Operators can instantly read *when* and *how long* a machine ran, idled, or stopped and correlate with shifts and programs.
- Pairing the timeline with a **Pareto of downtime reasons** supports root‑cause analysis.

**Examples & references**
- **MachineMetrics – “Current Shift Dashboard”** (real‑time factory dashboards with color‑coded status and OEE context).

UI / UX DESIGN
==============

This section documents the user interface and interaction design for the
Numerical Control Machine dashboard. The UI/UX team used Figma to create
a high-fidelity prototype that guided the frontend implementation.

Design Goals
------------

The main goals for the interface were:

* Provide a clear overview of machine status.
* Allow the client to explore details by date and/or time window.
* Make the relationship between utilisation, energy and alarms easy to
  understand.
* Keep the layout simple enough to be implemented efficiently

Global Layout and Navigation
----------------------------

The application uses a three-panel layout:

* A left sidebar with primary navigation:
    * ``Dashboard`` – overall machine status and key metrics. It will also bee the default entry point.
    * ``Energy`` – power and energy consumption views.
    * ``Alerts`` – alarm monitoring and drill-down.
* A top bar with a date selector. The date picker controls which
  day is displayed across all pages.
* A main content area where the cards and charts for each section
  are rendered.

Machine Utilisation Cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the lower part of the page (dashboard) there is a set of summary cards:

* Running Time – percentage and minutes the machine has been in a
  running state during the selected day.
* Idle Time – percentage and minutes in idle state.
* Down Time – percentage and minutes when the machine is down.

Each card combines:

* A large percentage value.
* A progress bar showing the relative proportion out of the 24h.
* A small caption with hours over the daily total.

This information is driven by the aggregation queries from the data
analysis team and the backend ETL.

Machine Status Timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a horizontal timeline that shows the machine status over 24 hours.

* Colours are used consistently: green (RUN) and red (IDLE). It didn't make sense to make
  differences between DOWN and IDLE visually (based on the data inputs), so both are shown in red.
* A time-window selector lets the user zoom into 30-minute intervals

Temperature and Program History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Dashboard page also contains:

* A Temperature History line chart displaying the evolution of key
  temperature variables during the day. The Data Analysis team filtered the relevant variables using
  statistical queries to remove noisy or useless signals.
* A Program History view that shows the duration of each CNC program
  during the day. Each program is represented by a colour and code
  (P1, P2, P3...).

Energy Screen
-------------

The Energy page focuses on power consumption and daily totals.

The main elements are:

* Hourly Energy Consumption line chart showing kWh usage during the day.
* Daily Total card with the total MWh for the selected day.
* Peak hour card showing the hour with the highest consumption and its consumption value.

Alerts Screen
-------------

The Alerts section allows the user to inspect alarms generated by the
machine.

Summary View
~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the top of the page there is an overview:

* Total number of alerts for the selected day.
* Breakdown by category: Emergency, Error, Warning and `other`.

The categorisation logic is based on text analysis of the alarm
descriptions (for example detecting keywords like *emergency*, *error*
or *warn*) and is implemented in the SQL queries from the DA team.

Alert List and Detail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The lower part of the page shows:

* A filter bar where the user can filter by alert type.
* A list of alerts showing one row per alarm with:
    * Category badge (Emergency / Error / Warning / Other).
    * Alarm code.
    * Date and time.
    * Description.
* A detail panel on the right showing:
    * Full timestamp.
    * Type.
    * Alarm code.
    * Description.

This structure supports quickly understanding of how many alarms
 occurred, when they happened and which ones require attention.

Collaboration with Frontend and Data Teams
------------------------------------------

The UI/UX work is tightly connected with the other sub-teams:

* The data analysis team designed the SQL queries that compute
  utilisation, working periods, stoppages, NaN intervals and alarm
  statistics. These queries defined which metrics could be shown in the
  UI and how they should be interpreted.
* The backend team exposed those metrics through FastAPI endpoints
  and ensured that response times stayed reasonably fast.
* The frontend team worked on implementing the Figma prototype using 
  the most suitable tools.

As a result the final interface closely matches the prototype while
remaining technically feasible and performant on top of the available
data.

DEVOPS & DEPLOYMENT
=====================

Overview
--------
This project does not rely on a full CI/CD pipeline, but it includes essential
deployment workflows and operational practices for both backend and frontend.

The target deployment environment is Vercel for the frontend and local or remote
server execution for the backend.


Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
----------------------------
The Next.js application is fully compatible with Vercel.

Deployment steps:

1. Push the frontend folder to GitHub.
2. Import the repository into Vercel.
3. Configure environment variables:

::

   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://backend-url

4. Deploy automatically.

Vercel handles:

* CI/CD  
* Build optimizations  
* Global CDN  
* Preview deployments  


Backend Deployment
------------------
The backend uses FastAPI and can be deployed via:

* Uvicorn  
* Gunicorn + Uvicorn workers  
* Docker  

Recommended deployment command:

::

   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000


Environment Variables
---------------------
Backend variables are loaded through `.env`. Place the file in the root of the backend
container or server.


Logs and Monitoring
-------------------
* Backend logs handled through Uvicorn  
* Vercel dashboard logs for frontend requests  
* PostgreSQL logging for ETL processes

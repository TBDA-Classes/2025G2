INTRODUCTION
============

Project Overview
----------------    

This project focuses on analyzing data collected from Numerical Control (CN) machines to transform high-frequency data into human-understandable insights.
The aim is to support operators and engineers by providing information on machine operation, energy usage, and alerts in a structured and accesible way.

Project Needs
-------------
Key needs that the solution must address include:

- Create a user interface to facilitate interaction
- Identify operation periods of the machine
- Determine when the machine is working
- Calculate timing and energy demands per program name
- Determine alerts and contextualize them

Solution approach
-----------------
To meet these needs, the team will use:

- BACKEND: FastAPI to process data, implement algorithms, and provide APIs
- FRONTEND: React to build an interactive user-friendly interface
- DATABASE: A SQL-based database for storing and querying high-frequency data

Team of the Project
-------------------

The team has followed an iterative approach using Scrum with weekly sprints.
The focus is to develop a minimal version of the system, covering the project needs, but that could also 
be expanded over time with new functionalities.

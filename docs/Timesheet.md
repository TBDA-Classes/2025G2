This file is used by all team members to record their working hours and activities.

## How to add a new activity

1. Scroll down to the **Activity Log Table** below.  
2. Add a **new row at the bottom of the table** following the same format.  
3. Do **not** modify other members’ entries.  
4. Make sure each field is separated by a vertical bar `|` and that you keep one space around it for readability.  
5. Use the date format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

If the text in “Description” is long, you can use line breaks (`<br>`) to keep it readable.  
Example:  
`Reviewed UI screens<br>Created wireframes for dashboard`
